# 0303 - http

The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. 

In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses â€” the user is able to stream data.

```js
http.get({
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  agent: false  // create a new agent just for this one request
}, (res) => {
  // Do stuff with response
});
```


### Http as web server
``` js
var http = require('http');

// create a server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  // write a response to the client
   res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.write('Hello World!'); 
  res.end(); //end the response
}).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
```
