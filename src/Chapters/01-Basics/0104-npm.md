# 0104 - npm

- As mentioned already in the previous page:
- NodeJS packages are managed using the **npm** - **N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager
- Additional packages can be installed globally and than they will be available for all node project or we can install locally which is the prefered way. 
- In Node project we distribue the list of the required packages along side with the src code.

## Using npm

### `npm init`
The first step is to create node project with the `init` command
```
    npm init [-y]
```

### `npm config`

- `list` - supply information regarding our local node/npm 
  ```
  # Print out cli & user local configuration
  npm config list

  # The -l flag to print out full local configuration
  npm config list -l

  ```
- `get` - retrieve configuration value 
  ```
  # return the current registry url
  npm config get registry
  ```

Whenever we change any of the default configuration npm write those changes to `.npmrc` file in our home directory.

### `npm i / install`
- `npm i` - Install npm packages, when using `npm i <package>`, npm will install it locally into the `./node_modules` folder
- Adding `-g` will install the packages into the "global" folder

### `npm ls / npm list [--global] [--depth=0]`
Option       |  Description
-------------|-------------
`npm list`   | print out list of installed packages.
`--global`   | print out global packages
`--depth=0`  | limit the output to the installed packages without their internal dependencies

### `npm search <term>`
- Search packages in the registered registry

---

## Executing `npm` command from `package.json`
- We can define custom & complex commands within the `package.json`
```
